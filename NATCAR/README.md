# Occam's Razor - NATCAR

## NATCAR - Autonomous Racecar
Worked in groups of 3 to design, build, and test an autonomous race car. 
* Coded, debugged, and optimized track detection software
* Interfaced linescan cameras, servo, and DC motors to a processor board
* Implemented PID control for steering

## OBJECTIVE
The objective of the course is to design and construct an autonomous race car that can
negotiate a preset course in the shortest possible time.

## SPECIFICATIONS
